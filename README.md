<h1 id="pokedex-with-razor-pages">Pokedex with Razor Pages</h1>
<p>A small project to apply the skills I have learned on a ASP.NET course through codecademy. The course goes through basic C# fundamentals, web architecture, razor pages, database design, middleware, dependency injection, and other core functionality of ASP.NET. The course can be found <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-web-apps-with-asp-net">here</a>, and my certificate of the course will be posted below when I have completed it. </p>
